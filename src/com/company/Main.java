package com.company;

public class Main {

    // When using the java-web-dev-exercises fork
        // had to change things to let it run:
            // go to file-> project structure ->
                // change sdk version to 11
                // change project level language to 11


    // here's a shortcut to producing the public static void main
    // type psvm and press enter
    // it should create a line that you see below
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // prints line to console
        System.out.println("Hello World!!");
        // in javascript we used console.log();
        // in Java, we use System.out.println();

        // Now uncomment the next line and run main
        // System.out.println('Hello World!!');
        // it should produce an error similar to the following:
        // 21:28 java: unclosed character literal
        // Now, remember in JavaScript we could say a string is
        // like this 'Hello string' or "Hello string" and those would
        // both be strings. In Java, we use double quotes("") for string
        // types and single quotes('') for character types. Java is more
        // strictly type, so we do not the have freedom to interchange
        // these anymore.
        // Now comment line 23 back out and make sure main runs without errors.
